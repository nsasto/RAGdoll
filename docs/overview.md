# RAGdoll Project Documentation

## Overview

RAGdoll is a modular framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document processing. It provides tools for chunking, embedding, ingestion, vector storage, graph storage, LLM integration, and more. The project is organized into feature-specific modules, each with clear responsibilities and extensibility in mind.
