RAGdoll Framework - Entity Extraction and Ingestion Pipeline
Current Status Analysis
Based on analysis of the RAGdoll codebase, significant progress has been made implementing the factory pattern for core components:

✅ Embedding Models - Complete with get_embeddings_model()
✅ Chunker - Complete with get_text_splitter() and split_documents()
✅ Graph Store - Complete with get_graph_store()
✅ Vector Store - Complete with get_vector_store()
Entity Extraction Analysis
The current entity extraction module is well-structured but needs integration into the factory pattern framework:

GraphCreationService in entity_extraction_service.py provides strong functionality
It extracts entities and relationships from text using LLMs
The module integrates with chunking and document processing
A factory interface implementation would bring consistency with the architecture
Next Phase Implementation Plan
1. Entity Extraction Factory
Current Status: Partially implemented with BaseEntityExtractor class, needs full factory implementation

Implementation Strategy:

Create a proper abstraction hierarchy with BaseEntityExtractor
Refactor GraphCreationService to clearly implement the interface
Add a factory function get_entity_extractor() that follows the established pattern
Support multiple implementation types while keeping configuration flexible
Interface Definition:

Factory Function:

2. Ingestion Pipeline
Current Status: Not implemented

Implementation Strategy:

Develop a unified process that coordinates all component factories
Support both sequential and parallel document processing
Add robust error handling and progress reporting
Create support for incremental updates to both vector and graph stores
Interface Definition:

4. Unified RAG Retriever
Current Status: Not implemented

Implementation Strategy:

Develop a hybrid retriever that leverages both vector and graph data
Support various retrieval strategies (semantic, structural, hybrid)
Provide relevance ranking mechanisms
Factory Function:
