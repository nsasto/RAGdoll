Technical Specification for Proposed Changes
This document outlines the detailed steps and implementation guidelines for integrating LangChain components into the RAGdoll project, focusing on modularity, compatibility, and leveraging LangChain's abstractions.

1. Vector Store Integration
Objective
Refactor BaseVectorStore to inherit from LangChain's VectorStore base class and implement concrete vector store integrations (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma).

Steps
Refactor BaseVectorStore:

Update BaseVectorStore to inherit from langchain.vectorstores.base.VectorStore.
Add methods for initialization and configuration from a config file.
Implement Concrete Stores:

Create classes for FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma by wrapping LangChain's implementations.
Ensure compatibility with the BaseVectorStore interface.
Deliverables
Updated base_vector_store.py with LangChain integration.
Concrete implementations for FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma.
2. Graph Store Integration
Objective
Integrate LangChain's community GraphStore abstraction into the existing BaseGraphStore while maintaining flexibility for custom implementations.

Steps
Install LangChain Community Module:

Refactor BaseGraphStore:

Add a new class LangChainGraphStore that wraps langchain_community.graphs.graph_store.GraphStore.
Implement the query_related method to delegate queries to the LangChain GraphStore.
Support Multiple Backends:

Configure LangChainGraphStore to support Neo4j or other graph databases via LangChain's community modules.
Deliverables
Updated base_graph_store.py with LangChain integration.
Example configuration for Neo4j or other supported graph databases.
3. Entity Extraction & Ingestion
Objective
Combine entity extraction with vector and graph ingestion pipelines to create a unified ingestion process.

Steps
Entity Extraction:

Retain the existing module for entity extraction.
Ingestion Pipeline:

Create a new class IngestionPipeline to handle:
Chunking of data.
Embedding generation.
Storing chunks in vector and graph stores.
Modular Design:

Ensure the pipeline is modular to allow swapping of components (e.g., embedding models, vector stores).
Deliverables
New ingestion_pipeline.py file with the IngestionPipeline class.
Unit tests for the ingestion pipeline.
4. Embedding Models
Objective
Retain the current embedding implementation but optionally wrap LangChain's langchain.embeddings module for compatibility.

Steps
Evaluate Current Implementation:

Ensure the current embedding models meet project requirements.
Optional Wrapping:

Add a wrapper class for LangChain's langchain.embeddings module to allow seamless integration.
Deliverables
Updated embeddings.py with optional LangChain wrapping.
5. Query Processor / Hybrid Retriever
Objective
Implement a HybridRetriever class that combines vector and graph-based retrieval.

Steps
Define HybridRetriever:

Create a class HybridRetriever that accepts a vector store and a graph store as inputs.
Implement the retrieve method to query both stores and merge results.
Merge Strategy:

Implement a _merge_results method to combine results from vector and graph stores.
Customize the merge strategy (e.g., deduplication, ranking).
Integration with LangChain:

Ensure the HybridRetriever is compatible with LangChain's RetrievalQA chain.
Deliverables
New hybrid_retriever.py file with the HybridRetriever class.
Example usage of HybridRetriever with LangChain's RetrievalQA.
6. Chains & Orchestration
Objective
Extend BaseChain to wrap LangChain's chain types and define reusable patterns for hybrid RAG workflows.

Steps
Refactor BaseChain:

Update BaseChain to include reusable methods for chain orchestration.
Add support for LangChain's SimpleSequentialChain, LLMChain, and RetrievalQA.
Define Hybrid RAG Chain:

Create a new chain class HybridRAGChain that uses HybridRetriever and LangChain's RetrievalQA.
Example Implementation:

Provide an example of a hybrid RAG chain using HybridRetriever and RetrievalQA.
Deliverables
Updated base_chain.py with LangChain integration.
New hybrid_rag_chain.py file with the HybridRAGChain class.
Example usage of HybridRAGChain.
Example Code Snippets

Testing Plan
Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for all new and updated classes.
Test edge cases for hybrid retrieval and ingestion pipelines.
Integration Tests:

Test the end-to-end workflow, including ingestion, retrieval, and chain execution.
Performance Tests:

Benchmark the hybrid retrieval process to ensure acceptable performance.
This spec provides a clear roadmap for implementing the proposed changes while maintaining modularity and extensibility.
